More Information
================

Here are some random links for getting started with, and using git and Sublime Text 2.

Git
~~~

For getting started with git, the book "Pro Git" by Scott Chacon is chock-full of great information, and it's available for free: http://git-scm.com/book

The git reference manual is a great place to look up specifics for commands: http://git-scm.com/docs

PeepCode also has a couple of good screencasts on git:

- https://peepcode.com/products/git
- https://peepcode.com/products/advanced-git

For a more academic and in-depth treatment, which can be very helpful for wrapping your head around git, see: http://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/git/

And last, but certainly not least, the help section on GitHub is excellent, and should be in your bookmarks: https://help.github.com/
