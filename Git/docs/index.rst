SublimeGit Documentation
========================

SublimeGit is a full-featured Git plugin for Sublime Text 2. It has been developed to be easy to get started with. If you're used to Git and dealing with Sublime Text packages, you can probably just install SublimeGit, and get right to work.

If installing Sublime Text packages, or using Git, is new to you, the :doc:`quickstart` is a great place to start. It will get you set up, so you can go on to the tutorial.

.. note::

    This documentation assumes some familiarity with Git. If you are not familiar with Git, be sure to check out the :doc:`more_information` section which contain links to a couple of resources for learning Git.
