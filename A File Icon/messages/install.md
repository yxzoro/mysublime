This package adds file specific icons to Sublime Text for improved visual grepping. 
It's heavily inspired by Atom File Icons.

***

1. Please restart Sublime Text for the applied icons to take effect.
2. The icons for packages provided by the community require to be installed. 
   E.g. if you want to see SCSS icon you should install one of the SCSS syntax packages.

I've put a lot of time and effort into making `A File Icon` awesome. If you love
