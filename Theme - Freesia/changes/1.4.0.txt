Freesia - 1.4.0

- Disclosure buttons have their own graphics.
- Sidebar disclosure buttons are visible only on hover now.
- Fold buttons now use the disclosure button graphics. They're tinted,
  so there might be issues with themes where the gutter color is too
  close to the fold button tint color. Nothing I use is, but we'll see.
- Folder icons are always visible. Remains to be seen if ST3 will have
  an option to disable icons entirely or if this is up to themes, so
  there's no option for this in the theme right now.
- Tab controls (i.e., the buttons on both sides of your tab strip) now
  use variants of the disclosure buttons.
- Kano's highlight color has been changed to an orange, similar to the
  sidebar headings.
