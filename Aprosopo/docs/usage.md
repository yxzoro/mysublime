Both the dark and light theme have the following colors that can be used as the base color or dirty color:

- aqua
- blue

- green
- orange
- purple
- red
- yellow

Tabs can be configured in a variety of ways:

The sidebar also has a number of configuration options:

Even the color scheme for the search bar inputs respond to color changes by altering their highlight color:

The theme is easily selected and configured from the menu:

## Setup
Everything is driven via the menu.  Go to `Preferences > Package Settings > Theme - Aprosopo` and set the theme with the color of your choice.  A restart may be required after initially setting the theme.  When changing features, resizing your window or restarting may be required to refresh the theme elements.  Themes can be unset from the menu as well which should completely cleanup all settings etc.

## Customizing
For personal tweaking, feel free to do whatever; fork it, mod it, and share it.  **There is no promise I will accept variations on the official branch**.

## Questions

### ST3 and ST2?
As far as I know.

### I am using ST3 version < 3062 and I don't have sidebar icons?
ST3 version 3062 introduced new sidebar file icons.  With this new addition, the theme displays the icons differently.  If you are using an ST3 version < 3062, you can use the menu option `Disable Sidebar File Icons` to revert to the old way of displaying folder icons to restore them.

### Retina?
Theoretically, but I don't have a retina display to test on.
